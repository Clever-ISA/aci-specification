# ACI Hardware Data Transfer Protocol Specification Version 1

This specification describes a data transfer protocol for peripherals and hardware components connected to a microprocessor for general user and external system interaction.

The system operates by a serial clock performing 32-bit parallel data transfers at a negotiated clock rate. The data transfers are addressed by a 12-bit Address bus,
 allowing access to 16KiB of memory per device, and is selected by a 16-bit device select identifer.

### §1.2 Power and Logic Rails 

The Host supplies 3 input voltages to each device, being 12 V and 5 V for power, and 3.3V for Logic. 12 V supply is present on pin 0, 5V on pin 2, and 3.3V Logic is on pin 98. Supply and Logic voltages are relative to GND.

The Standard Ground is pin 99, and is connected to all other ground pins as a common ground, all voltages may be returned from a device on a ground pin.

All logic pins are triggered on 3.3V for a logical 1, and 0V for a logical 0. A device may place a 1 on the line by connecting the 3.3V logic supply pin 98 to the logic pin, and a device may place a 0 on the line by connecting the common GND pin to the logic supply. 

The host shall ensure it supplies 3.3V for a logical 1 and 0V for a logical 0 with up to ±0.25V error, and shall accept between 2.1V and 6V for a logical 1, and shall accept between 0.7V and -1.4V for a logical 0. 

As a convinence, devices may use the 5V supply voltage for logic return, rather than 3.3V, and hosts must support this behaviour. However, all logic input from the host will be 5V supply.

## §2 Data Transfer and Clock

### §2.1 Clock Frequency

The Host shall supply the serial transfer clock to all devices on pin 41. The clock should generally be shared among devices, but a device placing a logic value on the clock line shall not interfere with any other device. According to the clock frequency, the clock shall be raised by the host to logic level 1 and then down to logic level 0 on a fixed interval, such that it becomes a particular logical level a number of times per second equal to the current clock frequency.

The Clock by default operates at 100 MHz and all devices must support this clock frequency at a minimum. During Device Initialization, a clock frequency is negotiated by the devices and the host, and may be up to the greatest frequency supported by all devices, in multiples of 2 kHz (see §3.2). When the clock speed is changed (see §3.2), 8 clock cycles are given in the old frequency, followed by a period of low signal equivalent to 8 cycles in the old frequency, followed by 8 cycles in the new frequency prior to any data transfers or comands being given.

### §2.2 Device Selection, DMA Address, DMA Data

THe device selection bus is a 16-bit host to device bus, that stores the device ID of the device to interact with. The value 0xFFFF refers to all connected and initialized devices - a host performing a read from all devices has no guaranteed result from any device, but writes may be performed to the same address with the same data.  Other values refer to a specific device and a device shall only respond to a transfer request with the device id programed during devise initialization (see §3.1)
